[1] Within the gates | ere a man shall go,

(Full warily let him watch,)

Full long let him look about him;

For little he knows | where a foe may lurk,

And sit in the seats within.



[2] Hail to the giver! | a guest has come;

Where shall the stranger sit?

Swift shall he be who, | with swords shall try

The proof of his might to make.



[3] Fire he needs | who with frozen knees

Has come from the cold without;

Food and clothes | must the farer have,

The man from the mountains come.



[4] Water and towels | and welcoming speech

Should he find who comes, to the feast;

If renown he would get, | and again be greeted,

Wisely and well must he act.



[5] Wits must he have | who wanders wide,

But all is easy at home;

At the witless man | the wise shall wink

When among such men he sits.



[6] A man shall not boast | of his keenness of mind,

But keep it close in his breast;

To the silent and wise | does ill come seldom

When he goes as guest to a house;

(For a faster friend | one never finds

Than wisdom tried and true.)



[7] The knowing guest | who goes to the feast,

In silent attention sits;

With his ears he hears, | with his eyes he watches,

Thus wary are wise men all.



[8] Happy the one | who wins for himself

Favor and praises fair;

Less safe by far | is the wisdom found

That is hid in another's heart.



[9] Happy the man | who has while he lives

Wisdom and praise as well,

For evil counsel | a man full oft

Has from another's heart.



[10] A better burden | may no man bear

For wanderings wide than wisdom;

It is better than wealth | on unknown ways,

And in grief a refuge it gives.



[11] A better burden | may no man bear

For wanderings wide than wisdom;

Worse food for the journey | he brings not afield

Than an over-drinking of ale.



[12] Less good there lies | than most believe

In ale for mortal men;

For the more he drinks | the less does man

Of his mind the mastery hold.



[13] Over beer the bird | of forgetfulness broods,

And steals the minds of men;

With the heron's feathers | fettered I lay

And in Gunnloth's house was held.



[14] Drunk I was, | I was dead-drunk,

When with Fjalar wise I was;

'Tis the best of drinking | if back one brings

His wisdom with him home.



[15] The son of a king | shall be silent and wise,

And bold in battle as well;

Bravely and gladly | a man shall go,

Till the day of his death is come.



[16] The sluggard believes | he shall live forever,

If the fight he faces not;

But age shall not grant him | the gift of peace,

Though spears may spare his life.



[17] The fool is agape | when he comes to the feast,

He stammers or else is still;

But soon if he gets | a drink is it seen

What the mind of the man is like.



[18] He alone is aware | who has wandered wide,

And far abroad has fared,

How great a mind | is guided by him

That wealth of wisdom has.



[19] Shun not the mead, | but drink in measure;

Speak to the point or be still;

For rudeness none | shall rightly blame thee

If soon thy bed thou seekest.



[20] The greedy man, | if his mind be vague,

Will eat till sick he is;

The vulgar man, | when among the wise,

To scorn by his belly is brought.



[21] The herds know well | when home they shall fare,

And then from the grass they go;

But the foolish man | his belly's measure

Shall never know aright.



[22] A paltry man | and poor of mind

At all things ever mocks;

For never he knows, | what he ought to know,

That he is not free from faults.



[23] The witless man | is awake all night,

Thinking of many things;

Care-worn he is | when the morning comes,

And his woe is just as it was.



[24] The foolish man | for friends all those

Who laugh at him will hold;

When among the wise | he marks it not

Though hatred of him they speak.



[25] The foolish man | for friends all those

Who laugh at him will hold;

But the truth when he comes | to the council he learns,

That few in his favor will speak.



[26] An ignorant man | thinks that all he knows,

When he sits by himself in a corner;

But never what answer | to make he knows,

When others with questions come.



[27] A witless man, | when he meets with men,

Had best in silence abide;

For no one shall find | that nothing he knows,

If his mouth is not open too much.

(But a man knows not, | if nothing he knows,

When his mouth has been open too much.)



[28] Wise shall he seem | who well can question,

And also answer well;

Nought is concealed | that men may say

Among the sons of men.



[29] Often he speaks | who never is still

With words that win no faith;

The babbling tongue, | if a bridle it find not,

Oft for itself sings ill.



[30] In mockery no one | a man shall hold,

Although he fare to the feast;

Wise seems one oft, | if nought he is asked,

And safely he sits dry-skinned.



[31] Wise a guest holds it | to take to his heels,

When mock of another he makes;

But little he knows | who laughs at the feast,

Though he mocks in the midst of his foes.



[32] Friendly of mind | are many men,

Till feasting they mock at their friends;

To mankind a bane | must it ever be

When guests together strive.



[33] Oft should one make | an early meal,

Nor fasting come to the feast;

Else he sits and chews | as if he would choke,

And little is able to ask.



[34] Crooked and far | is the road to a foe,

Though his house on the highway be;

But wide and straight | is the way to a friend,

Though far away he fare.



[35] Forth shall one go, | nor stay as a guest

In a single spot forever;

Love becomes loathing | if long one sits

By the hearth in another's home.



[36] Better a house, | though a hut it be,

A man is master at home;

A pair of goats | and a patched-up roof

Are better far than begging.



[37] Better a house, | though a hut it be,

A man is master at home;

His heart is bleeding | who needs must beg

When food he fain would have.



[38] Away from his arms | in the open field

A man should fare not a foot;

For never he knows | when the need for a spear

Shall arise on the distant road.



[39] If wealth a man | has won for himself,

Let him never suffer in need;

Oft he saves for a foe | what he plans for a friend,

For much goes worse than we wish.



[40] None so free with gifts | or food have I found

That gladly he took not a gift,

Nor one who so widely | scattered his wealth

That of recompense hatred he had.



[41] Friends shall gladden each other | with arms and garments,

As each for himself can see;

Gift-givers' friendships | are longest found,

If fair their fates may be.



[42] To his friend a man | a friend shall prove,

And gifts with gifts requite;

But men shall mocking | with mockery answer,

And fraud with falsehood meet.



[43] To his friend a man | a friend shall prove,

To him and the friend of his friend;

But never a man | shall friendship make

With one of his foeman's friends.



[44] If a friend thou hast | whom thou fully wilt trust,

And good from him wouldst get,

Thy thoughts with his mingle, | and gifts shalt thou make,

And fare to find him oft.



[45] If another thou hast | whom thou hardly wilt trust,

Yet good from him wouldst get,

Thou shalt speak him fair, | but falsely think,

And fraud with falsehood requite.



[46] So is it with him | whom thou hardly wilt trust,

And whose mind thou mayst not know;

Laugh with him mayst thou, | but speak not thy mind,

Like gifts to his shalt thou give.



[47] Young was I once, | and wandered alone,

And nought of the road I knew;

Rich did I feel | when a comrade I found,

For man is man's delight.



[48] The lives of the brave | and noble are best,

Sorrows they seldom feed;

But the coward fear | of all things feels,

And not gladly the niggard gives.



[49] My garments once | in a field I gave

To a pair of carven poles;

Heroes they seemed | when clothes they had,

But the naked man is nought.



[50] On the hillside drear | the fir-tree dies,

All bootless its needles and bark;

It is like a man | whom no one loves,--

Why should his life be long?



[51] Hotter than fire | between false friends

Does friendship five days burn;

When the sixth day comes | the fire cools,

And ended is all the love.



[52] No great thing needs | a man to give,

Oft little will purchase praise;

With half a loaf | and a half-filled cup

A friend full fast I made.



[53] A little sand | has a little sea,

And small are the minds of men;

Though all men are not | equal in wisdom,

Yet half-wise only are all.



[54] A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,

But never too much let him know;

The fairest lives | do those men live

Whose wisdom wide has grown.



[55] A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,

But never too much let him know;

For the wise man's heart | is seldom happy,

If wisdom too great he has won.



[56] A measure of wisdom | each man shall have,

But never too much let him know;

Let no man the fate | before him see,

For so is he freest from sorrow.



[57] A brand from a brand | is kindled and burned,

And fire from fire begotten;

And man by his speech | is known to men,

And the stupid by their stillness.



[58] He must early go forth | who fain the blood

Or the goods of another would get;

The wolf that lies idle | shall win little meat,

Or the sleeping man success.



[59] He must early go forth | whose workers are few,

Himself his work to seek;

Much remains undone | for the morning-sleeper,

For the swift is wealth half won.



[60] Of seasoned shingles | and strips of bark

For the thatch let one know his need,

And how much of wood | he must have for a month,

Or in half a year he will use.



[61] Washed and fed | to the council fare,

But care not too much for thy clothes;

Let none be ashamed | of his shoes and hose,

Less still of the steed he rides,

(Though poor be the horse he has.)



[62] When the eagle comes | to the ancient sea,

He snaps and hangs his head;

So is a man | in the midst of a throng,

Who few to speak for him finds.



[63] To question and answer | must all be ready

Who wish to be known as wise;

Tell one thy thoughts, | but beware of two,--

All know what is known to three.



[64] The man who is prudent | a measured use

Of the might he has will make;

He finds when among | the brave he fares

That the boldest he may not be.



[65] -lacuna- A man must be watchful | and wary as well,

-lacuna- And fearful of trusting a friend.

Oft for the words | that to others one speaks

He will get but an evil gift.



[66] Too early to many | a meeting I came,

And some too late have I sought;

The beer was all drunk, | or not yet brewed;

Little the loathed man finds.



[67] To their homes men would bid | me hither and yon,

If at meal-time I needed no meat,

Or would hang two hams | in my true friend's house,

Where only one I had eaten.



[68] Fire for men | is the fairest gift,

And power to see the sun;

Health as well, | if a man may have it,

And a life not stained with sin.



[69] All wretched is no man, | though never so sick;

Some from their sons have joy,

Some win it from kinsmen, | and some from their wealth,

And some from worthy works.



[70] It is better to live | than to lie a corpse,

The live man catches the cow;

I saw flames rise | for the rich man's pyre,

And before his door he lay dead.



[71] The lame rides a horse, | the handless is herdsman,

The deaf in battle is bold;

The blind man is better | than one that is burned,

No good can come of a corpse.



[72] A son is better, | though late he be born,

And his father to death have fared;

Memory-stones | seldom stand by the road

Save when kinsman honors his kin.



[73] Two make a battle, | the tongue slays the head;

In each furry coat | a fist I look for.



[74] He welcomes the night | whose fare is enough,

(Short are the yards of a ship,)

Uneasy are autumn nights;

Full oft does the weather | change in a week,

And more in a month's time.



[75] A man knows not, | if nothing he knows,

That gold oft apes begets;

One man is wealthy | and one is poor,

Yet scorn for him none should know.



[76] Among Fitjung's sons | saw I well-stocked folds,--

Now bear they the beggar's staff;

Wealth is as swift | as a winking eye,

Of friends the falsest it is.



[77] Cattle die, | and kinsmen die,

And so one dies one's self;

But a noble name | will never die,

If good renown one gets.



[78] Cattle die, | and kinsmen die,

And so one dies one's self;

One thing now | that never dies,

The fame of a dead man's deeds.



[79] Certain is that | which is sought from runes,

That the gods so great have made,

And the Master-Poet painted;

-lacuna-

-lacuna- of the race of gods:

Silence is safest and best.



[80] An unwise man, | if a maiden's love

Or wealth he chances to win,

His pride will wax, but his wisdom never,

Straight forward he fares in conceit.



[81] Give praise to the day at evening, | to a woman on her pyre,

To a weapon which is tried, | to a maid at wed lock,

To ice when it is crossed, | to ale that is drunk.



[82] When the gale blows hew wood, | in fair winds seek the water;

Sport with maidens at dusk, | for day's eyes are many;

From the ship seek swiftness, | from the shield protection,

Cuts from the sword, | from the maiden kisses.



[83] By the fire drink ale, | over ice go on skates;

Buy a steed that is lean, | and a sword when tarnished,

The horse at home fatten, | the hound in thy dwelling.



[84] A man shall trust not | the oath of a maid,

Nor the word a woman speaks;

For their hearts on a whirling | wheel were fashioned,

And fickle their breasts were formed.



[85] In a breaking bow | or a burning flame,

A ravening wolf | or a croaking raven,

In a grunting boar, | a tree with roots broken,

In billowy seas | or a bubbling kettle,



[86] In a flying arrow | or falling waters,

In ice new formed | or the serpent's folds,

In a bride's bed-speech | or a broken sword,

In the sport of bears | or in sons of kings,



[87] In a calf that is sick | or a stubborn thrall,

A flattering witch | or a foe new slain.



[88] In a brother's slayer, | if thou meet him abroad,

In a half-burned house, | in a horse full swift--

One leg is hurt | and the horse is useless--

None had ever such faith | as to trust in them all.



[89] Hope not too surely | for early harvest,

Nor trust too soon in thy son;

The field needs good weather, | the son needs wisdom,

And oft is either denied.



[90] The love of women | fickle of will

Is like starting o'er ice | with a steed unshod,

A two-year-old restive | and little tamed,

Or steering a rudderless | ship in a storm,

Or, lame, hunting reindeer | on slippery rocks.



[91] Clear now will I speak, | for I know them both,

Men false to women are found;

When fairest we speak, | then falsest we think,

Against wisdom we work with deceit.



[92] Soft words shall he speak | and wealth shall he offer

Who longs for a maiden's love,

And the beauty praise | of the maiden bright;

He wins whose wooing is best.



[93] Fault for loving | let no man find

Ever with any other;

Oft the wise are fettered, | where fools go free,

By beauty that breeds desire.



[94] Fault with another | let no man find

For what touches many a man;

Wise men oft | into witless fools

Are made by mighty love.



[95] The head alone knows | what dwells near the heart,

A man knows his mind alone;

No sickness is worse | to one who is wise

Than to lack the longed-for joy.



[96] This found I myself, | when I sat in the reeds,

And long my love awaited;

As my life the maiden | wise I loved,

Yet her I never had.



[97] Billing's daughter | I found on her bed,

In slumber bright as the sun;

Empty appeared | an earl's estate

Without that form so fair.



[98] "Othin, again | at evening come,

If a woman thou wouldst win;

Evil it were | if others than we

Should know of such a sin."



[99] Away I hastened, | hoping for joy,

And careless of counsel wise;

Well I believed | that soon I should win

Measureless joy with the maid.



[100] So came I next | when night it was,

The warriors all were awake;

With burning lights | and waving brands

I learned my luckess way.



[101] At morning then, | when once more I came,

And all were sleeping still,

A dog found | in the fair one's place,

Bound there upon her bed.



[102] Many fair maids, | if a man but tries them,

False to a lover are found;

That did I learn | when I longed to gain

With wiles the maiden wise;

Foul scorn was my meed | from the crafty maid,

And nought from the woman I won.



[103] Though glad at home, | and merry with guests,

A man shall be wary and wise;

The sage and shrewd, | wide wisdom seeking,

Must see that his speech be fair;

A fool is he named | who nought can say,

For such is the way of the witless.



[104] I found the old giant, | now back have I fared,

Small gain from silence I got;

Full many a word, | my will to get,

I spoke in Suttung's hall.



[105] The mouth of Rati | made room for my passage,

And space in the stone he gnawed;

Above and below | the giants' paths lay,

So rashly I risked my head.



[106] Gunnloth gave | on a golden stool

A drink of the marvelous mead;

A harsh reward | did I let her have

For her heroic heart,

And her spirit troubled sore.



[107] The well-earned beauty | well I enjoyed,

Little the wise man lacks;

So Othrörir now | has up been brought

To the midst of the men of earth.



[108] Hardly, methinks, | would I home have come,

And left the giants' land,

Had not Gunnloth helped me, | the maiden good,

Whose arms about me had been.



[109] The day that followed, | the frost-giants came,

Some word of Hor to win,

(And into the hall of Hor;)

Of Bolverk they asked, | were he back midst the gods,

Or had Suttung slain him there?



[110] On his ring swore Othin | the oath, methinks;

Who now his troth shall trust?

Suttung's betrayal | he sought with drink,

And Gunnloth to grief he left.



[111] It is time to chant | from the chanter's stool;

By the wells of Urth I was,

I saw and was silent, | I saw and thought,

And heard the speech of Hor.

(Of runes heard I words, | nor were counsels wanting,

At the hall of Hor,

In the hall of Hor;

Such was the speech I heard.)



[112] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,---

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Rise not at night, | save if news thou seekest,

Or fain to the outhouse wouldst fare.



[113] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Beware of sleep | on a witch's bosom,

Nor let her limbs ensnare thee.



[114] Such is her might | that thou hast no mind

For the council or meeting of men;

Meat thou hatest, | joy thou hast not,

And sadly to slumber thou farest.



[115] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Seek never to win | the wife of another,

Or long for her secret love.



[116] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

If o'er mountains or gulfs | thou fain wouldst go,

Look well to thy food for the way.



[117] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

An evil man | thou must not let

Bring aught of ill to thee;

For an evil man | will never make

Reward for a worthy thought.



[118] I saw a man | who was wounded sore

By an evil woman's word;

A lying tongue | his death-blow launched,

And no word of truth there was.



[119] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

If a friend thou hast | whom thou fully wilt trust,

Then fare to find him oft;

For brambles grow | and waving grass

On the rarely trodden road.



[120] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

A good man find | to hold in friendship,

And give heed to his healing charms.



[121] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Be never the first | to break with thy friend

The bond that holds you both;

Care eats the heart | if thou canst not speak

To another all thy thought.



[122] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Exchange of words | with a witless ape

Thou must not ever make.



[123] For never thou mayst | from an evil man

A good requital get;

But a good man oft | the greatest love

Through words of praise will win thee.



[124] Mingled is love | when a man can speak

To another all his thought;

Nought is so bad | as false to be,

No friend speaks only fair.



[125] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

With a worse man speak not | three words in dispute,

Ill fares the better oft

When the worse man wields a sword.



[126] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

A shoemaker be, | or a maker of shafts,

For only thy single self;

If the shoe is ill made, | or the shaft prove false,

Then evil of thee men think.



[127] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

If evil thou knowest, | as evil proclaim it,

And make no friendship with foes.



[128] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

In evil never | joy shalt thou know,

But glad the good shall make thee.



[129] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Look not up | when the battle is on,--

(Like madmen the sons | of men become,--)

Lest men bewitch thy wits.



[130] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

If thou fain wouldst win | a woman's love,

And gladness get from her,

Fair be thy promise | and well fulfilled;

None loathes what good he gets.



[131] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

I bid thee be wary, | but be not fearful;

(Beware most with ale or another's wife,

And third beware | lest a thief outwit thee.)



[132] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,-

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Scorn or mocking | ne'er shalt thou make

Of a guest or a journey-goer.



[133] Oft scarcely he knows | who sits in the house

What kind is the man who comes;

None so good is found | that faults he has not,

Nor so wicked that nought he is worth.



[134] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Scorn not ever | the gray-haired singer,

Oft do the old speak good;

(Oft from shrivelled skin | come skillful counsels,

Though it hang with the hides,

And flap with the pelts,

And is blown with the bellies.)



[135] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

Curse not thy guest, | nor show him thy gate,

Deal well with a man in want.



[136] Strong is the beam | that raised must be

To give an entrance to all;

Give it a ring, | or grim will be

The wish it would work on thee.



[137] I rede thee, Loddfafnir! | and hear thou my rede,--

Profit thou hast if thou hearest,

Great thy gain if thou learnest:

When ale thou drinkest) | seek might of earth,

(For earth cures drink, | and fire cures ills,

The oak cures tightness, | the ear cures magic,

Rye cures rupture, | the moon cures rage,

Grass cures the scab, | and runes the sword-cut;)

The field absorbs the flood.



[138] Now are Hor's words | spoken in the hall,

Kind for the kindred of men,

Cursed for the kindred of giants:

Hail to the speaker, | and to him who learns!

Profit be his who has them!

Hail to them who hearken!



[139] I ween that I hung | on the windy tree,

Hung there for nights full nine;

With the spear I was wounded, | and offered I was

To Othin, myself to myself,

On the tree that none | may ever know

What root beneath it runs.



[140] None made me happy | with loaf or horn,

And there below I looked;

I took up the runes, | shrieking I took them,

And forthwith back I fell.



[141] Nine mighty songs | I got from the son

Of Bolthorn, Bestla's father;

And a drink I got | of the goodly mead

Poured out from Othrörir.



[142] Then began I to thrive, | and wisdom to get,

I grew and well I was;

Each word led me on | to another word,

Each deed to another deed.



[143] Runes shalt thou find, | and fateful signs,

That the king of singers colored,

And the mighty gods have made;

Full strong the signs, | full mighty the signs

That the ruler of gods doth write.



[144] Othin for the gods, | Dain for the elves,

And Dvalin for the dwarfs,

Alsvith for giants | and all mankind,

And some myself I wrote.



[145] Knowest how one shall write, | knowest how one shall rede?

Knowest how one shall tint, | knowest how one makes trial?

Knowest how one shall ask, | knowest how one shall offer?

Knowest how one shall send, | knowest how one shall sacrifice?



[146] Better no prayer | than too big an offering,

By thy getting measure thy gift;

Better is none | than too big a sacrifice,

-lacuna-

So Thund of old wrote | ere man's race began,

Where he rose on high | when home he came.



[147] The songs I know | that king's wives know not,

Nor men that are sons of men;

The first is called help, | and help it can bring thee

In sorrow and pain and sickness.



[148] A second I know, | that men shall need

Who leechcraft long to use;

-lacuna-

-lacuna-



[149] A third I know, | if great is my need

Of fetters to hold my foe;

Blunt do I make | mine enemy's blade,

Nor bites his sword or staff.



[150] A fourth I know, | if men shall fasten

Bonds on my bended legs;

So great is the charm | that forth I may go,

The fetters spring from my feet,

Broken the bonds from my hands.



[151] A fifth I know, | if I see from afar

An arrow fly 'gainst the folk;

It flies not so swift | that I stop it not,

If ever my eyes behold it.



[152] A sixth I know, | if harm one seeks

With a sapling's roots to send me;

The hero himself | who wreaks his hate

Shall taste the ill ere I.



[153] A seventh I know, | if I see in flames

The hall o'er my comrades' heads;

It burns not so wide | that I will not quench it,

I know that song to sing.



[154] An eighth I know, | that is to all

Of greatest good to learn;

When hatred grows | among heroes' sons,

I soon can set it right.



[155] A ninth I know, | if need there comes

To shelter my ship on the flood;

The wind I calm | upon the waves,

And the sea I put to sleep.



[156] A tenth I know, | what time I see

House-riders flying on high;

So can I work | that wildly they go,

Showing their true shapes,

Hence to their own homes.



[157] An eleventh I know, | if needs I must lead

To the fight my long-loved friends;

I sing in the shields, | and in strength they go

Whole to the field of fight,

Whole from the field of fight,

And whole they come thence home.



[158] A twelfth I know, | if high on a tree

I see a hanged man swing;

So do I write | and color the runes

That forth he fares,

And to me talks.



[159] A thirteenth I know, | if a thane full young

With water I sprinkle well;

He shall not fall, | though he fares mid the host,

Nor sink beneath the swords.



[160] A fourteenth I know, | if fain I would name

To men the mighty gods;

All know I well | of the gods and elves,

Few be the fools know this.



[161] A fifteenth I know, | that before the doors

Of Delling sang Thjothrörir the dwarf;

Might he sang for the gods, | and glory for elves,

And wisdom for Hroptatyr wise.



[162] A sixteenth I know, | if I seek delight

To win from a maiden wise;

The mind I turn | of the white-armed maid,

And thus change all her thoughts.



[163] A seventeenth I know, | so that seldom shall go

A maiden young from me;

-lacuna-

-lacuna-



[164] Long these songs | thou shalt, Loddfafnir,

Seek in vain to sing;

Yet good it were | if thou mightest get them,

Well, if thou wouldst them learn,

Help, if thou hadst them.



[165] An eighteenth I know, | that ne'er will I tell

To maiden or wife of man,--

The best is what none | but one's self doth know,

So comes the end of the songs,--

Save only to her | in whose arms I lie,

Or who else my sister is.
